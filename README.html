<h1 id="all-credit-goes-to-the-original-authors-of-the-base-and-addons">ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS OF THE BASE AND ADDONS</h1>
<p>All of the addons are commented in every file change with the proper support URL for each!<br />I take NO credit for any addons or developments.</p>
<p>osCommerce 2.3.4 with Bootstrap UI and some necessary Addons...<br />##This should not be confused with the work of Gary Burton main osCommerce 2.3.4 Bootstrap Edge version at https://github.com/gburton/Responsive-osCommerce</p>
<p>The idea of this fork is to create an up-to-date bootstrap osCommerce with specific addons.<br />##THIS IS NOT THE PREFERRED INSTALLATION<br />__It does give a base for a working store with the following addons</p>
<p>Addons have been specially commented so to easily find changes. All original code will remain, but they will be commented out for any changes.<br />All changes can be found by doing a search for the special commenting system of asterisks.</p>
<p>THIS REPO IS FOR ADDON ADDITIONS/FIXES ONLY<br />__:::Current Add-on Listing:::</p>

<p>This is an attempt to get a strong working osc with some addons. This is NOT an independent project. Without the help of MANY coders that have contributed to osCommerce, this would not be possible. I did not code any of the modules, addons, or base software that you see here.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE CREATED A PRIVATE ADDON THAT YOU SEE LISTED HERE AND IT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, please list it within the issues, and I will have it removed.</p>
<p>Links and descriptions will be used for all addon changes. Please contribute if you can.</p>

<p>!!!USING THE STANDARD OSCOMMERCE SQL INSTALLATION MAY REMOVE SOME TABLES FOR ADDONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE INSTALLED!!!</p>
<p>Install as if this is a new osCommerce installation. Then enter the admin area and turn on 3 new Header Tag modules;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>colorbox</li>
<li>datepicker</li>
<li>grid/list view</li>
</ol>
<p>The functionality of these have been moved to header tag modules so that the site will only load them on the pages needed rather than on all pages. Admin &gt; Modules &gt; Header Tags &gt; {install}</p>
<p>You also need to install other components such as the logo, breadcrumb, footer boxes, side column boxes and so on. Admin &gt; Modules &gt; Boxes &gt; {install} AND Admin &gt; Modules &gt; Content &gt; {install}. Boxes and Modules can be sorted using the sort order, lowest is displayed first.</p>

<h1 id="security-pro-r11">Security Pro R11</h1>
<p>If you would like a file to be excluded from the security cleansing, be sure to <strong>MANUALLY</strong> add that file in ../catalog/includes/application_top.php while uncommenting around line 65: // If you need to exclude a file from cleansing then you can add it like below //$security_pro-&gt;addExclusion( 'some_file.php' );</p>
<p><strong>Try your hardest</strong> not to exclude files in this manner. If they are payment or shipping files then fine .. but not for badly written contributions, in these cases the contribution should be modified so that it no longer passes bad characters. Also never be tempted to weaken Security Pro by adding characters to the whitelist, you will restrict the scripts ability to do its job.</p>
