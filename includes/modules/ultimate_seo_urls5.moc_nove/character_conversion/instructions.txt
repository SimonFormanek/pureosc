 Although special language characters replacement can still be used via admin it is very limited.
 
 You now have the ability to add individual character conversion files to the following directory:
 
 catalog/includes/modules/ultimate_seo_urls5/includes/character_conversion
 
 The files must be named exactly the same as your language file in catalog/includes/languages/
 
 e.g. danish.php or german.php or espanol.php etc.
 
 For most of these files I have tried to put the special characters in the array but it is up to you to add the English equivilents.
 
 I also have tried to save the files in a relevant encoding but again, it is up to you to ensure the encoding matches
 the output of your site.
 
 Once you have added files to the character_conversion folder these will take precedence and the admin settings will not work for that particular language.
 
 Once a character conversion file has been completed it would be a great help to others if you could email the file to me so that I can add the full
 files to the next release.
