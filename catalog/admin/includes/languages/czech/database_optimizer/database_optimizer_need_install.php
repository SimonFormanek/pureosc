Let\'s face it. The oscommerce package is a great piece of work but it wouldn\'t be very useful
if it wasn\'t for addons. And if you have spent any time installing addons, you know that some are not too 
difficult to install but others can seem impossible to get to work, especially if other addons are already 
installed. But, not to worry. That\'s one of the things we specialize in. So if you need an addon installed,
please do not hesitate to <a style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:support@oscommerce-solution.com">email us</a> 
for a quote. Discounts are available for some addons and we offer further
discounts for larger orders.
