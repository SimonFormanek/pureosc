<div class="section_block_line">If you are in need of a host that actually knows the oscommerce package and is easy 
to work with, then please consider us. Unlike many hosts nowadays, we handle transferring the site for free. 
Plus we set it up and verify the settings are correct before turning it over, again, for free. 
You can see our basic hosting plans 
<a class="section_email_blue" href="http://www.oscommerce-solution.com/hosting-plans.php">here</a> 
though we offer many more hosting options. 
</div>

<div style="padding-top:10px">
While comparing our plans to those of other hosts, please consider these points:
<ul>
<li>Don\'t fall into the trap 
many hosts set when they offer unlimited disk space and bandwidth. Besides being physically impossible, 
if you check their Terms of Service agreement, you will find there are restrictions. And if the site 
becomes too large for storage, they will almost always say that your site is loading down the server 
and needs to be moved to a VPS or Dedicated server. In some cases this may be true but we have had 
many hosting members move to us after being told this by their previous host and their sites work fine 
on our shared servers. We offer VPS\'s and Dedicated servers also but why pay extra if it is not needed?
</li>
<li>It is important to note that we do not charge for additional accounts. If the plan you choose
is large enough to handle more than one domain name, there is not an additional charge for doing so. 
</li>
<li>We transfer and setup the shop for you. There\'s no need to worry if the files are setup correctly
or if data will be lost. Plus, once the shop is setup, we check its settings to be sure they are set
correctly. We find the majority of shops are not set up as they should be.
</li>
<li>All new hosting accounts get a free SSL certificate. If your site already has a certificate,
we will apply this when that certificate expires. 
</li>
<li>All new hosting accounts get a free keyword position report, which is very important for optimizing
a site for the search engines.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="padding-top:10px">So it is important to realize what you are paying for and what you 
are receiving as a result. Even if you are only curious at how we can help improve your hosting 
experience, please <a style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:support@oscommerce-solution.com">contact us</a> and ask for a quote.

hear us say we cannot fix whatever problem you may have with your site.
